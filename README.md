# TEST APPROACH
The aim of this framework is to cover the 4 main functionalities: Create, Read, Update and Delete as well as Login and Logout. I choose this approach because from these 4 functionalities it is possible create more scripts for positive and negative tests. The baseline is ready.

I created this framework with Java, Selenium and TestNG, and structured in a way that no data is left in the application. So, feel free to change the data and execute as much as you want. Also, for debug purposes (that was very helpful during the creation of this framework), I included a log feature for each step. The test results can be extracted from the "test-output" folder in HTML format. You can see the results on both "index.html" and "emailable-report.html".

Kick-off the test from "TownSend/src/framework/BasePage.java". Also, for better maintenability and reusability, I organized the features in modules at "appModules" package and the pages definitions in an repository package named "pageObjects". 

The data (at testData package) is recorded in an Excel spreadsheet. At last, I grouped some support files in the "utility" package.

1. Open the project TownSend in Eclipse;
2. From Project Explorer, navigate through TownSend -> src -> framework and run the file "BasePage.java" as TestNG Test;
3. The test will perform a CRUD with 6 test cases: SignIn, Create, Read, Update, Delete and SignOut against Caf√© Townsend website. No records will be left after execution.

# Log file
In the root directory, you will find the log file (logfile.log) with details about the test execution.
